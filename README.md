# surveyQR-Gen
 
A QR Code generator that allows the user to input an ID, which is added to the end of the survey form URL as an argument. This complete URL is then converted into a QR Code that can be added to presentations, infographics, or other materials to be scanned.

The program also allows the user to retrieve the file that stores all survey responses. Every response includes the provided ID for the class it is for.
