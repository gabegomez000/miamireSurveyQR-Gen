# surveyQR-Gen
 
A QR Code generator that allows the user to input an ID and adds it to the form URL as an argument. It is then converted into a scannable QR Code that can be clicked on or saved as an image to be used in other ways.

The program also allows the user to retrieve the file that stores all survey responses. Every response includes the provided ID for the class it is for (Or none, if no argument was provided for that response.)
